Description : You need to urgently log into the facility admin portal to reactivate the security system. Can you figure out a way to login?

Enumeration :

The main page of the website again includes a login portal. 

However, we can notice the name of the challenge includes the word "Inspection", which might be a clue that it might have something to do with source code inspection.


Exploitation :

Let's do "Ctrl + U" and check the frontend source code.


Loooll, that was the most difficult web challenge of all time.

FLAG : MetaCTF{inspect1ng_th3_c0de}
