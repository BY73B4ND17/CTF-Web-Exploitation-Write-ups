Description : You've been tasked with testing the security of this Electricity Substation management portal. Can you figure out what framework/programming language and version are used to run this app?

- Enumeration :

The main page is a login portal which includes two fields : Username and Password.

Let's enter random credentials and try to login.

But nothing happened on clicking "Login". Hmm..Weird :(.

I even thought of checking the source code, but found nothing.

- Exploitation : 

If we read the description again, the challenge demands us to figure out the framework/ programming language and the version used to run this app.

So, we absolutely know a tool which would help us find that : Burpsuite!

So let's reload this website and check the HTTP request on Burpsuite.

So here's our GET request to the website on Burp Proxy, and in the Server Header of Response, we can see our flag.

`FLAG : MetaCTF{i_am_running_python_flask}`
